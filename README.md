# 🔧 Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict machine failures based on sensor data. Built using the **AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset**, it demonstrates how ML can be applied to real-world industrial IoT problems.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Predict whether a machine is going to fail based on telemetry and sensor data — helping industries save time, money, and lives.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name**: AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset)
- Contains telemetry data like temperature, torque, tool wear, and product type.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Train-Test Split: 80-20
- Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results
- ✅ Achieved good accuracy for machine failure prediction
- ✅ Visualized feature importance for interpretability
